# Fitness-Workout-Insights-A-Tableau-Data-Analysis-Project

## Overview  
This project explores **fitness and health trends** using **Tableau**, analyzing key metrics such as **heart rate, workout intensity, VO2 Max, steps, calories burned, and more**. The dataset contains **10,000+ workout records**, allowing for deep insights into **gender, age, BMI, and performance factors**.  

**Key Deliverables:**  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboards** 
- **Tableau Story for Presentation**   
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization** 

## Data Analysis & Visualizations  
This project includes **11 key visualizations** to uncover insights:  

1️⃣ **Gender Distribution** – Understanding participant demographics.  
2️⃣ **Age Distribution** – Identifying fitness trends across age groups.  
3️⃣ **Heart Rate by Workout Intensity** – Analyzing cardiovascular response to workouts.  
4️⃣ **Steps Taken vs. Distance** – Measuring movement efficiency.  
5️⃣ **Sleep Hours vs. Calories Burned** – Examining the link between rest and energy expenditure.  
6️⃣ **Age vs. BMI** – Observing weight trends over different age groups.  
7️⃣ **Height vs. Heart Rate** – Exploring the impact of height on heart rate.  
8️⃣ **Heart Rate vs. Age by Gender** – Tracking cardiovascular health by gender.  
9️⃣ **Resting Heart Rate vs. Age by Gender** – Identifying trends in baseline heart rate.  
🔟 **VO2 Max vs. Age by Gender** – Assessing endurance levels across age groups.  
🔢 **Age, Gender, Weight, and VO2 Max Relationship** – A combined analysis of key fitness indicators.  

## How to Use  
### **1️⃣ View the Tableau Dashboard**  
📌 The final Tableau Story and Dashboard are available on **[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hemang.sharma6675/viz/DataAnalysis_17409761323500/Dashboard?publish=yes)**.  

### **2️⃣ Clone This Repository**  
To download and explore the Tableau workbook:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemangsharma/Fitness-Workout-Insights-A-Tableau-Data-Analysis-Project.git

```
  
### **3️⃣ Open in Tableau**  
- Download **Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop**.  
- Open `fitness_insights.twbx` to explore the analysis.  

## 📈 Insights & Key Takeaways  
- **Higher workout intensity = Increased heart rate.**  
- **More sleep leads to better workout performance.**  
- **VO2 Max declines with age but is influenced by weight & gender.**  
- **Personalized training should be based on age, weight, and heart rate trends.**  

## 📢 Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate **machine learning predictions** on fitness outcomes.  
- Add **real-time analytics** from smart wearables.  
- Expand dataset to include **nutrition, hydration, and stress levels**.
